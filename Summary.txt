I have built a simple To-Do List API using Node.js and Express. This basic backend allows you to view all tasks, add new ones, and delete existing tasks. It serves as a foundational structure for developing a complete to-do application.
API Endpoints:
1. Retrieve All Tasks
View the complete list of tasks.
Method: GET
Endpoint: /tasks
2. Add a New Task
Create a new task by sending a JSON object.
Method: POST
Endpoint: /addTask
Example Request Body:
{ "taskName": "Cricket" }
3. Delete a Task by ID
Remove a task by specifying its ID.
Method: DELETE
Endpoint: /task/:id
Example: /task/1
